Studio Ghibli themed redirect to my GitHub portfolio.

GitHub pages doesn't recognize mobile transforms, so image-loading and absolute positioning doesn't translate well from web to mobile.

The best bet is to create your own animation using flex layout.

The cool thing about GitHub pages is that it is a free way to host an animation.  

Still a work in progress...
